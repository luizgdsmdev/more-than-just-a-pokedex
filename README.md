## Project Description

The *More Than Just a Pokédex* project is a comprehensive web application that goes beyond a traditional Pokédex. It was developed to practice and showcase JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills, with an emphasis on consuming APIs, manipulating the DOM, applying conditional styling, and optimizing code. The project features an interactive interface for exploring Pokémon data, comparing items, simulating battles, and tracking Pokémon and trainer evolution, with ongoing updates to add new features and refinements.

This project was created for practices using JavaScript/HTML/CSS, such as:
- API consumption;
- DOM manipulation;
- Conditional styling;
- Data control and processing/consumption;
